《被讨厌的勇气》
================


作者：岸见一郎

1956年生于京都，高中时便以哲学为志向，进入大学后屡次到老师府上进行辩论。京都大学研究生院文学研究系博士课程满期退学。1989年起致力于研究专业哲学和阿德勒心理学。
主要活动领域是阿德勒（Alfred Adler，1870-1937）心理学及古代哲学的执笔与演讲，同时还在精神科医院为许多青年做心理辅导。日本阿德勒心理学会认定顾问。

作者：古贺史健

1973年出生，以对话创作（问答体裁）见长，他创作的极具现场感与节奏感的采访稿广受好评，采访集《16岁的教科书》系列累计销量突破70万册。著有《想要让20岁的自己接受的文章讲义》。
近30岁的时候邂逅阿德勒心理学，并被其颠覆常识的思想所震撼。之后，连续数年拜访京都的岸见一郎并向其请教阿德勒心理学的本质。本书中他以希腊哲学的古典手法“对话篇”进行内容呈现。

勇气的心理学
----------------

《被讨厌的勇气》并不是要去吸引被讨厌的负向能量，而是，如果这是我生命想绽放出最美的光彩，那么，即使有被讨厌的可能，我都要用自己的双手双脚往那里走去。
因为拥有了被讨厌的勇气，于是有了真正幸福的可能。


自我的枷锁和解放
----------------

Need more than processors to build a system
  * Large cost to license other IPs in SoC: cache, interconnect, graphics, camera ISP, etc.
  * Need an attractive open-source platform to try new hardware ideas.
  * Security and trusted execution are not complete without a full-system support.
  * RISC-V hardware extensions: JIT runtime, vector, etc.

The community lacks affordable RISC-V hardware platforms that run a variety of software
  * Few low-cost, software-capable boards for the long tail of developers.
  * Developers won’t spend $1000 for a new hardware just for software development.


一切烦恼都来自人际关系
----------------

* **Independently Maintained**: The RIOS Lab will be the solo nonprofit organization that governs the architecture development, ensures compliance, and will publish the design. The RIOS Lab will be the gatekeeper for both hardware and software, from SoC and firmware/drivers to high-level software and documentation. PicoRio will be vendor agnostic and not proprietary, and the RIOS Lab will work with academic and commercial organizations that will commit to its expansion and volume manufacturing.

* **Open Source**: PicoRio will open source as many components as possible, including the CPU and main SoC design, chip package and board design files, device drivers, and firmware. The exceptions are foundry related IPs (e.g., TSMC SRAM configurations), commercial high-speed interfaces, and complex commercial IP blocks like GPU. Nevertheless, our goal is to reduce the commercial closed source IPs for each successive release of PicoRio, with the long term goal of having a version that is as open as practical.

* **High-Quality IPs**: A major goal of the RIOS Lab is to develop open-source, industrial strength hardware IPs to help the RISC-V ecosystem catch up with those of the older, proprietary ISAs. Thus, PicoRio aims at a high-quality silicon release using open-source IP. The IPs will have gone through rigorous real tapeout verifications that meet industry quality. The openness of PicoRio will not come at the cost of lower quality IP blocks. In addition, we will open source our verification process, which will help to improve transparency and trustworthiness.

* **Modern Software Stack Support**: PicoRio utilizes a heterogeneous multicore architecture and is Linux-capable. We also designed PicoRio hardware to run modern managed languages such as JavaScript/WebAssembly as well as graphical applications like the Chrome web browser. At the RIOS Lab, PicoRio is also the hardware platform for several other open-source software projects, like the RISC-V ports for the V8 Javascript engine and the Chromium OS.

* **Low-Power and Low-Cost**: The target metrics of PicoRio are long battery life and low cost, which is a better match to RISC-V today, instead of high performance and large memory.
